# FSL
few-shot learning experiments

CNN: 4 convolutional blocks

DaNN: cnn based DaNN

Prototypical Nets:

ssProto: add attention mechanism to semi-supervised Prototypical Nets

Note that: the ssProto has an improved version `semi-supervised meta-learning networks(SSMN)`, and hasb een published in the journal of `Knowledge Based System`, the new codes can be found here[https://github.com/fyancy/DASMN].
