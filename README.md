# FSL
few-shot learning experiments

CNN: 4 convolutional blocks

DaNN: cnn based DaNN

Prototypical Nets:

ssProto: add attention mechanism to semi-supervised Prototypical Nets

# Notes
For the ssProto, we have an improved version named `semi-supervised meta-learning networks(SSMN)`, which has been published in the journal of `ISA Transactions`. The new codes can be found [here](https://github.com/fyancy/SSMN).
