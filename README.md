# FSL
few-shot learning experiments

CNN: 4 convolutional blocks

DaNN: cnn based DaNN

Prototypical Nets:

ssProto: add attention mechanism to semi-supervised Prototypical Nets

Note that: For the ssProto, we have an improved version named `semi-supervised meta-learning networks(SSMN)`, and has been published in the journal of `Knowledge Based System`, the new codes can be found (here)[https://github.com/fyancy/DASMN].
